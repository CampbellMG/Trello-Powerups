            All CMGCode power-ups are completely open source and solely rely on the client (your web browser) to process
            your data. No plugins access personally identifiable information or submit data to anywhere except Trello.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some power-ups (such as the Merge Lists power-up) may request you to authorise the plugin on your behalf.
            This is necessary for us to be able to access board data such as checklists or add new data such as cards.
            We will never modify a board without your request or access board data without your knowledge. If you would
            like to revoke a plugin's authorisation you can do so by selecting the "Remove personal settings" button in
            the plugin settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to have a look at what's going on behind the scenes you can find the source code for all
            plugins here: <a href={Config.repo}>{Config.repo}</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at <a href={Config.email}>{Config.email}</a>.
